# Feature Specification: TypeScript Syntax To Generated Zig Native Binary

**Feature Branch**: `001-typescript-to-zig-native`

**Created**: 2026-06-25

**Status**: Draft

**Input**: User description: "Stop targeting Test262; build a TypeScript-syntax
language that compiles to generated Zig and then to a native binary."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Compile A TypeScript Source File (Priority: P1)

A developer writes a `.ts` source file using the accepted V1 TypeScript syntax
subset and compiles it into a native executable.

**Why this priority**: This is the core product promise.

**Independent Test**: `compile examples/valid/hello.ts` produces a native
executable that prints the expected output.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a `.ts` file containing top-level code and `console.log`, **When**
   the compiler runs, **Then** it emits generated Zig and produces a native
   binary.
2. **Given** a `.ts` file containing integer arithmetic, **When** the binary is
   executed, **Then** it prints the computed result.

---

### User Story 2 - Keep JavaScript Dynamism Out (Priority: P1)

A developer receives clear diagnostics when source uses dynamic JavaScript
features that cannot belong to a predictable native compiler.

**Why this priority**: Native compilation depends on fixed static semantics.

**Independent Test**: Invalid examples using `eval`, prototype mutation, or
CommonJS fail before Zig generation.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** source containing `eval`, **When** checked, **Then**
   `E_UNSUPPORTED_EVAL` is reported.
2. **Given** source containing `String.prototype.x = ...`, **When** checked,
   **Then** `E_UNSUPPORTED_PROTOTYPE` is reported.
3. **Given** source containing `require("fs")`, **When** checked, **Then**
   `E_UNSUPPORTED_COMMONJS` is reported.

---

### User Story 3 - Use Familiar Static Types (Priority: P2)

A developer uses TypeScript syntax with Lumen numeric spellings such as `int`
and `i32`.

**Why this priority**: The language should feel close to TypeScript while still
being precise enough for native output.

**Independent Test**: Valid examples using `let a = 4`, `int`, `i32`, `number`,
`boolean`, and `string` type-check and lower to Zig.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** `let a = 4`, **When** checked, **Then** `a` is inferred as `int`.
2. **Given** `let x: i32 = 4`, **When** checked, **Then** the type is accepted.
3. **Given** assignment of a string to an integer variable, **When** checked,
   **Then** `E_TYPE_MISMATCH` is reported.
4. **Given** `type User = { id: int }` and `let user: User = { id: 7 }`,
   **When** checked, **Then** the object literal is accepted as `User` and
   `user.id` is typed as `int`.
5. **Given** `let total = 1` followed by `total = total + 2`, **When**
   checked, **Then** reassignment is accepted.
6. **Given** `const total = 1` followed by `total = 2`, **When** checked,
   **Then** `E_CONST_ASSIGNMENT` is reported.
7. **Given** `console.log` receives a string, boolean, or numeric value,
   **When** emitted, **Then** the generated native program prints it using the
   checked source type.
8. **Given** `true` or `false` appears in an expression, **When** parsed,
   **Then** it is treated as a boolean literal rather than a variable name.
9. **Given** an `if` statement with a boolean condition, **When** compiled,
   **Then** the native program executes the matching block.
10. **Given** an `if` statement with a non-boolean condition, **When** checked,
    **Then** `E_TYPE_MISMATCH` is reported.
11. **Given** a `while` statement with a non-boolean condition, **When**
    checked, **Then** `E_TYPE_MISMATCH` is reported.
12. **Given** two declarations with the same name in the same lexical scope,
    **When** checked, **Then** `E_DUPLICATE_BINDING` is reported.
13. **Given** a block declares a name that exists in an outer scope, **When**
    checked, **Then** the inner declaration shadows only within that block.
14. **Given** arithmetic or ordered comparison operands with incompatible
    types, **When** checked, **Then** `E_TYPE_MISMATCH` is reported.
15. **Given** a top-level typed function declaration with typed parameters and
    a declared return type, **When** compiled, **Then** it is emitted into the
    generated native artifact.
16. **Given** a call to a declared function, **When** checked, **Then** argument
    count and argument types must match the function signature.
17. **Given** a function return expression, **When** checked, **Then** its type
    must match the declared return type.
18. **Given** a `void` function call used as a statement, **When** checked,
    **Then** it is accepted; **Given** the same call is used as a value,
    **Then** `E_VOID_VALUE` is reported.
19. **Given** a top-level function call appears before its declaration, **When**
    checked, **Then** it resolves against the later function declaration.
20. **Given** `import add from "./math.ts"`, **When** compiling the entry file,
    **Then** the compiler loads the local relative `.ts` file at build time and
    makes its declarations available to the entry program.
21. **Given** boolean expressions using `&&`, `||`, and `!`, **When** checked,
    **Then** operands must be boolean and the generated native program preserves
    TypeScript operator precedence.
22. **Given** a function declaration inside a block or another function body,
    **When** checked, **Then** the compiler reports that nested function
    declarations are unsupported in V1.
23. **Given** a typed array declaration such as `let nums: int[] = [1, 2]`,
    **When** checked and emitted, **Then** elements must match the declared
    element type, integer indexing is allowed, and `.length` returns an integer.
24. **Given** string values, **When** using `.length` or `string + string`,
    **Then** `.length` returns an integer and `+` concatenates string contents.
25. **Given** calls to supported `Math` APIs, **When** checked, **Then**
    numeric argument types and arity are validated before lowering to native
    operations.
26. **Given** `try`/`catch`/`throw` source using `Error("message")`, **When**
    compiled, **Then** thrown error messages can be observed as `err.message`
    inside the catch block and `finally` runs after catch handling.
27. **Given** local default imports and `export default function`, **When**
    compiling an entry file, **Then** the imported function is available under
    the local default binding and import cycles or duplicate imports receive
    stable diagnostics.
28. **Given** V1 stdlib namespace calls, **When** checked, **Then** console,
    Math, String, and Array helpers validate argument counts and static types
    before lowering.
29. **Given** a `class` declaration, **When** checked for V1, **Then** the
    compiler rejects it with a stable diagnostic until class layout semantics
    are designed.

### Edge Cases

- Generated Zig is allowed to exist on disk, but it is not the source language.
- The old JavaScript interpreter/Test262 conformance path is not a V1 compiler
  requirement.
- `.ts` is the V1 source extension.
- Remote packages and package manager behavior are out of scope.
- Standard-library wrappers should be designed explicitly rather than inherited
  wholesale from Node or the old runtime.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The compiler MUST accept `.ts` files as the primary source input.
- **FR-002**: The compiler MUST lower accepted source to generated Zig before
  invoking native compilation.
- **FR-003**: The compiler MUST produce a native executable for valid MVP
  programs.
- **FR-004**: The source language MUST use TypeScript syntax, not a new custom
  surface syntax.
- **FR-005**: The checker MUST infer `let a = 4` as `int`.
- **FR-006**: The checker MUST accept both `int` and `i32` for 32-bit signed
  integer values.
- **FR-007**: The compiler MUST reject `eval`.
- **FR-008**: The compiler MUST reject prototype access and prototype mutation.
- **FR-009**: The compiler MUST reject CommonJS `require`.
- **FR-010**: The compiler MUST reject dynamic object shape mutation.
- **FR-011**: Generated Zig paths, diagnostics, and panic mapping MUST point back
  to the original `.ts` source when possible.
- **FR-012**: The compiler track MUST NOT use Test262 conformance as a product
  requirement.
- **FR-013**: Remote packages, package managers, and raw URL/GitHub imports MUST
  be excluded from this V1 compiler slice.
- **FR-014**: Named object type declarations MUST define closed static shapes.
  Object literals assigned to those names MUST provide exactly the declared
  fields with compatible field types.
- **FR-014A**: Named object type fields MAY reference other named object types,
  and the checker MUST validate nested object literals recursively.
- **FR-014B**: Arrays of named object types such as `FileScore[]` MUST be
  accepted when every element is assignable to the named object type. Indexing
  such arrays MUST expose the named element type for field access.
- **FR-014C**: Named object values MUST be assignable through function
  parameters and return statements when their closed static shapes match the
  declared parameter or return type.
- **FR-015**: `let` declarations MUST create reassignable bindings and `const`
  declarations MUST create non-reassignable bindings.
- **FR-016**: `console.log` emission MUST use the checked argument type rather
  than assuming every argument is an integer.
- **FR-017**: The compiler MUST accept `true` and `false` as boolean literals.
- **FR-018**: The compiler MUST accept TypeScript-style `if`, `else if`, and
  `else` block statements and require every branch condition to be boolean.
- **FR-019**: The compiler MUST require `while` conditions to be boolean.
- **FR-019A**: The compiler MUST accept TypeScript-style `for` loops in the
  V1 form `for (let name = init; condition; name = update) { ... }`. The
  initializer MUST create a loop-scoped mutable binding, the condition MUST be
  boolean, and the update MUST type-check as an assignment.
- **FR-019A1**: The compiler MUST accept TypeScript-style `do { ... } while
  (condition);` loops. The body MUST run before the condition is checked, the
  condition MUST be boolean, and `continue;` inside the body MUST evaluate the
  condition before the next iteration.
- **FR-019B**: The compiler MUST accept postfix update statements `name++` and
  `name--`, prefix update statements `++name` and `--name`, plus compound
  assignment statements `name += value`, `name -= value`, `name *= value`,
  `name /= value`, and `name %= value`, for numeric mutable bindings. Update
  operators are statement syntax in V1 and MUST NOT yet be treated as
  value-producing expressions.
- **FR-019C**: The compiler MUST accept `break;` and `continue;` inside
  `while` and `for` loop bodies. The checker MUST reject those statements
  outside loops with stable diagnostics, and `continue` inside a `for` loop MUST
  still run the loop update step.
- **FR-019D**: The compiler MUST accept TypeScript-style ternary expressions
  `condition ? thenExpr : elseExpr`. The condition MUST be boolean and both
  expression arms MUST have the same static type.
- **FR-019E**: The compiler MUST accept V1 TypeScript-style `switch`
  statements with `case` labels, an optional `default`, and `break;` inside
  switch cases. Case expressions MUST have the same static type as the switch
  expression. V1 switch cases MUST be isolated branches and MUST NOT implicitly
  fall through.
- **FR-019F**: The compiler MUST accept named string literal union aliases such
  as `type Mode = "dev" | "prod";`. Values assigned to those aliases, passed as
  function arguments, returned from functions, or used as switch cases MUST be
  one of the declared string literals.
- **FR-020**: `let`, `const`, and `var` declarations MUST be tracked in
  lexical scopes, reject duplicate declarations in the same scope, and allow
  shadowing in nested block scopes.
- **FR-020A**: Variable bindings and top-level function signatures MUST be
  stored in checker-owned symbol tables before Zig emission.
- **FR-021**: Arithmetic operators MUST require compatible numeric operands.
- **FR-022**: Ordered comparison operators MUST require compatible numeric
  operands; equality operators MUST require compatible operand types.
- **FR-023**: The compiler MUST accept top-level TypeScript-style function
  declarations with typed parameters, an explicit return type, and block bodies.
- **FR-024**: Function calls MUST check argument count and argument types against
  the declared function signature.
- **FR-025**: `return` statements MUST appear inside functions and return values
  MUST match the declared function return type.
- **FR-026**: `void` function calls MUST be allowed as statements but rejected
  when used as values.
- **FR-027**: Top-level function declarations MUST be available throughout the
  source file, including before their declaration point.
- **FR-028**: The compiler MUST support local relative default imports from
  `.ts` files during build, and MUST NOT support remote URLs or package
  resolution for this V1 slice.
- **FR-029**: Unsupported import forms MUST produce `E_UNSUPPORTED_IMPORT`, and
  missing local imported files MUST produce `E_IMPORT_NOT_FOUND`.
- **FR-030**: Non-`void` functions MUST return on all simple checked paths;
  direct `return` and `if`/`else` branches where both sides return count as
  returning.
- **FR-031**: Bare `return;` MUST be accepted only in `void` functions and MUST
  be rejected in non-`void` functions.
- **FR-032**: String equality and inequality MUST compare string contents, not
  backend slice identity.
- **FR-033**: Boolean operators `&&`, `||`, and `!` MUST use TypeScript syntax,
  MUST require boolean operands, and MUST lower to native boolean operations.
- **FR-034**: Function declarations MUST be top-level only in V1; function
  declarations nested inside blocks or function bodies MUST be rejected with
  `E_UNSUPPORTED_NESTED_FUNCTION`.
- **FR-035**: The compiler MUST accept TypeScript-style array type annotations
  for primitive V1 element types, array literals, integer indexing, and
  `.length`; array literals MUST contain values compatible with their element
  type.
- **FR-036**: String values MUST support `.length` and `string + string`
  concatenation; mixed string/non-string `+` MUST be rejected with
  `E_TYPE_MISMATCH`.
- **FR-037**: The compiler MUST support the V1 `Math` namespace functions
  `abs`, `max`, and `min`; unsupported stdlib members MUST be rejected with
  `E_UNSUPPORTED_STD`.
- **FR-037A**: The compiler MUST support `Math.sign`, `Math.clamp`, and
  `Math.sqrt` with statically checked numeric arguments.
- **FR-037B**: The compiler MUST support `String.isEmpty`, `String.contains`,
  `String.startsWith`, and `Array.isEmpty` as namespace stdlib helpers without
  adding prototype dispatch.
- **FR-037C**: The compiler MUST support `console.error` as a V1 console API
  sibling to `console.log`.
- **FR-037D**: The compiler MUST support the V1 process and filesystem helpers
  `argsCount()`, `arg(index)`, and `fs.readFileSync(path, encoding?)` for native CLI tooling.
  `argsCount()` MUST return the native argument count, `arg(index)` MUST return
  the argument at a zero-based index or an empty string when absent, and
  `fs.readFileSync(path, encoding?)` MUST return file contents as a string or an
  empty string when the file cannot be read. The optional `encoding` argument
  MUST be accepted as a string for Node-like call shape; V1 treats the result as
  UTF-8 text.
- **FR-038**: The compiler MUST support TypeScript-style `throw`,
  `try`/`catch`, optional `finally`, `Error("message")`, and `err.message` for
  caught errors; thrown values MUST be Error values.
- **FR-039**: Local default imports MUST support imported `export default
  function` declarations, MUST detect import cycles, and MUST reject duplicate
  import specifiers in the same source file.

### Diagnostics

- **E_UNSUPPORTED_EVAL**: Produced when source uses `eval`.
- **E_UNSUPPORTED_PROTOTYPE**: Produced when source reads or writes prototype
  mutation surfaces.
- **E_UNSUPPORTED_COMMONJS**: Produced when source uses `require`.
- **E_DYNAMIC_PROPERTY_WRITE**: Produced when source writes a dot-notation
  property (`obj.field = ...`) on a non-class record type, declared field
  or not — not specifically "undeclared" writes, this entry's original
  meaning. **Amended by spec 342**: bracket/index-notation writes
  (`obj["field"] = ...`) were moved off this code entirely, onto a
  separate, deliberately code-less diagnostic; this doc was never updated
  to match until spec 510's follow-up doc-drift sweep caught it.
- **E_TYPE_MISMATCH**: Produced when assigned value type is incompatible with
  the declared or inferred variable type.
- **E_CONST_ASSIGNMENT**: Produced when source attempts to assign a new value to
  a `const` binding.
- **E_DUPLICATE_BINDING**: Produced when a declaration repeats a name already
  declared in the same lexical scope.
- **E_ARG_COUNT**: Produced when a function call provides the wrong number of
  arguments.
- **E_RETURN_TYPE**: Produced when `return;` (no value) appears where the
  function's declared return type requires one. **Amended by spec 218**:
  a *value* incompatible with the declared return type — this entry's
  original meaning — now reports the consolidated `E_TYPE_MISMATCH`
  instead (`failTypeMismatch`, used by every `ensureAssignable` mismatch
  path including returns); this doc was never updated to match.
- **E_RETURN_OUTSIDE_FUNCTION**: Produced when `return` appears outside a
  function body.
- **E_VOID_VALUE**: Produced when source attempts to use a `void` expression as
  a value.
- **E_UNSUPPORTED_IMPORT**: Produced for remote, bare, named, or otherwise
  unsupported import forms.
- **E_IMPORT_NOT_FOUND**: Produced when a local relative imported `.ts` file
  cannot be read.
- **E_MISSING_RETURN**: Produced when a non-`void` function can complete without
  returning a value.
- **E_UNSUPPORTED_NESTED_FUNCTION**: Produced when a function declaration
  appears outside the top-level source scope.
- **E_UNSUPPORTED_STD**: Produced when source calls a stdlib namespace member
  that is not part of the V1 supported surface.
- **E_THROW_TYPE**: Produced when source throws a value that is neither an
  `Error` nor a `string`. **Amended by spec 249**: a bare string throw
  (this entry's original "non-Error value" wording implied it was
  rejected too) is now accepted; this doc was never updated to match
  until spec 510's follow-up doc-drift sweep caught it.
- **E_IMPORT_CYCLE**: Produced when local import expansion detects a cycle.
- **E_DUPLICATE_IMPORT**: Produced when a source file imports the same
  specifier more than once.
- **E_UNSUPPORTED_CLASS**: Retired (spec 010 designed and shipped V1's static
  class/object layout semantics; this code no longer exists in the
  checker). This doc was never updated to match until spec 510's
  follow-up doc-drift sweep caught it — see `specs/010-classes/spec.md`.

### Existing JavaScript Infrastructure

This repository already contains a mature JavaScript lexer, parser, and AST for
the legacy engine path. Lumen V1 does not use those modules as its language
contract because they encode JavaScript semantics that are out of scope for this
compiled language, including prototypes, dynamic object shapes, CommonJS-era
runtime behavior, and broad ECMAScript grammar. Lumen compiler modules may reuse
ideas from that code, but accepted source behavior is defined by this spec and
the Lumen compiler track.

### Key Entities

- **Source program**: A `.ts` file written in the accepted TypeScript syntax
  subset.
- **Generated Zig artifact**: Compiler output used to produce the native binary.
- **Native binary**: The executable produced by the host Zig compiler.
- **Static checker**: Compiler phase that assigns and validates fixed source
  types before code generation.
- **Named object type**: A TypeScript-style `type` declaration whose object
  fields define a closed native shape for checking and code generation.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: A valid `.ts` hello program compiles to a native executable and
  prints the expected output.
- **SC-002**: At least three unsupported dynamic JavaScript examples fail before
  generated Zig is emitted.
- **SC-003**: At least one typed arithmetic example verifies `int`/`i32`
  behavior.
- **SC-004**: Project docs describe the branch as TypeScript-to-Zig-to-binary,
  not as a Test262 conformance effort.
- **SC-005**: `zig build conformance` runs the V1 manifest, compiles/runs valid
  cases, compares expected output, and checks invalid diagnostics.

## Assumptions

- Zig remains the native backend for this branch.
- The existing `src/lumen_compiler.zig` prototype is the starting
  implementation, but its single-pass shape may change.
- Existing ljs runtime code can remain in the repo while the active product track
  moves to the compiler.
