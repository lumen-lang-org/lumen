# Spec 042: http module

## Goal

Replace the two existing bare-bones global functions (`httpGet(url) -> i64`,
status-only; `serve(port, body)`, one canned response to every request)
with a real `http` namespace covering the practical core of
[Node's `http` module](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html): making requests
with a method/body and reading the real response, and running a server that
actually inspects the request and returns a real per-request response.

**This is explicitly not a 1:1 port of Node's `http` API**, and that's a
deliberate scoping decision, not an oversight -- see "Why not the real
Node shape" below. What ships is the practical intent of the module
(client requests, server request/response), in a shape that fits Lumen's
existing static-function-and-record stdlib pattern, the same pattern
every other module (`fs`, `path`, `url`, `child_process`) already uses.

## Node's real API surface (for reference, from nodejs.org/api/http.html)

- **Top-level**: `http.request(options, callback)`, `http.get(options,
  callback)`, `http.createServer([options], requestListener)`.
- **Classes**: `http.Server` (emits `'request'`/`'connection'`/etc.),
  `http.IncomingMessage` (headers/method/url/statusCode, a readable
  stream), `http.ServerResponse`/`http.ClientRequest` (both extend
  `OutgoingMessage`: `write()`/`end()`/`setHeader()`, a writable stream),
  `http.Agent` (connection pooling).
- **Constants**: `http.METHODS`, `http.STATUS_CODES`.
- **Utilities**: header validation, `http.globalAgent`, proxy config.

## Why not the real Node shape

Every one of Node's classes above is built on two things Lumen doesn't
have: **`EventEmitter`** (`'request'`, `'data'`, `'end'`, `'error'`, ...)
and **streams** (chunked, backpressure-aware reading/writing). Both are
real, separate, much larger features (an `EventEmitter` needs a listener-
registration and dispatch mechanism; a `Stream` needs an abstraction over
chunked async I/O) that nothing in the stdlib has built yet -- `fs`, `os`,
and `process` all hit and documented the same wall for their own
async/streaming gaps. Porting the literal class hierarchy without those
foundations would mean fake classes that don't behave like Node's at all,
which is worse than not having them.

Two more Node idioms don't fit today for reasons already established
elsewhere in the stdlib:

- **Header collections**: Node passes headers as a plain object (or a
  `Headers`-like map). Lumen has no growable-array or `Map`-construction
  path from inside a stdlib builtin (the same gap that deferred
  `querystring`/`URLSearchParams` off of `url`). Custom headers are
  deferred for the same reason.
- **`(req, res) => { ... }` as the server callback**: block-bodied arrow
  functions only parse in specific contexts today (confirmed while
  testing spec 038's timers), and Node's mutate-`res`-in-place style
  doesn't fit the functional, record-returning shape the rest of the
  stdlib uses. The handler is a **named top-level function that takes a
  request record and returns a response record** instead -- the same
  working pattern already used for `setInterval`'s callback.

## API (the practical subset that ships)

### Client (Phase 1)

| Function | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `http.request(url, method, body)` | `(string, string, string) -> HttpResponse` | one-shot request; `body` is ignored (pass `""`) for methods that don't take one |
| `http.get(url)` | `string -> HttpResponse` | convenience wrapper, `http.request(url, "GET", "")` |

`HttpResponse` record: `{ status: int, body: string, ok: bool }`. `ok` is
`status >= 200 and status < 300`, sparing every caller from writing that
range check themselves (a small, deliberate addition beyond Node's own
shape, which leans on this being cheap to compute once here). Built on
`std.http.Client.fetch`'s existing `method`/`payload`/`response_writer`
options -- confirmed capable of exactly this (checked the real struct
definition directly, not assumed), a genuine capability upgrade over the
current status-only `httpGet`.

**Benchmark against Node's native `http` client**: ~1.5x faster on 300
sequential GETs against a local server (`--release-fast`, ~110ms vs Node
20's ~160ms for the equivalent loop). Found and fixed a real bug while
measuring this: the client was reloading and re-parsing the system CA
certificate bundle from disk on *every single call*, including plain
non-TLS `http://` requests that never need it -- a ~5x improvement on its
own (Lumen measured ~3.5x *slower* than Node before this fix). Now the CA
bundle is only scanned for `https://` URLs, matching what Node's own
client does.

### Server (Phase 2)

| Function | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `http.createServer(port, handler)` | `(int, (HttpRequest) -> HttpResponse) -> void` | blocking accept loop, calls `handler` per request, never returns |

`HttpRequest` record: `{ method: string, path: string, body: string }`.
The handler returns the *same* `HttpResponse` record the client side
already uses (`{ status, body, ok }`), not a second, similar-but-different
record -- one shape to learn instead of two. `ok` goes unused by the
server (it just reads `.status`/`.body` to write the response), the same
"construct a literal by hand, fill every field" simplification
`path.format`'s record parameter already established. Real per-request
parsing (method, path, `Content-Length`-based body), reusing the exact
manual HTTP/1.1 parsing approach the playground's own compile service
(`playground/server.zig`) already proves works -- not a new, unverified
technique.

**Benchmark against Node's own `http.createServer`**, using the same
Node.js client against both (isolating the server implementation as the
only variable): Node initially won, ~165ms vs Lumen's ~235ms on 300
sequential GETs (Lumen roughly 1.3-1.5x slower). Root cause: the server was
sending `Connection: close` and tearing the socket down after every
response (matching the old `serve()` global's exact behavior), forcing a
fresh TCP handshake per request, while Node's server keeps the connection
alive by default. Unlike the earlier CA-bundle-rescan/`EventEmitter`
reallocation bugs (accidental, zero-tradeoff waste, fixed immediately),
this needed a real feature, not a one-line patch -- added HTTP keep-alive:
the reader/writer are now set up once per accepted connection, with an
inner loop reading and answering requests off that same connection until
the client sends `Connection: close` or the connection drops (checked, via
`curl -v`, that a real client's second request actually reuses the first
connection rather than opening a new one). After: Lumen measured ~139ms
vs Node's ~157ms on the same 300-request loop -- Lumen now modestly faster
(~1.1-1.2x), not just closing the gap.

## Migration note

Checked for existing call sites of the two functions this replaces:
`httpGet`/`serve` appear nowhere except their own `website/stdlib.html`
Planned-table mention -- no example, test, or playground code depends on
either. Free to alias, supersede, or remove them during implementation
without a compatibility concern.

## Revisited now that `EventEmitter<T>` exists (spec 043)

`EventEmitter<T>` shipped after this spec was first written. It doesn't
change the core request/response design below: request/response is a
call-and-return pattern (one request in, one response out), not a
broadcast/pub-sub pattern, so `EventEmitter` isn't actually the right tool
for the request-handling path itself -- the functional
`(HttpRequest) -> HttpResponse` handler design still stands. What it *does*
newly unblock is **server lifecycle notifications** that are genuinely
event-shaped (`'error'` on a listen failure, `'close'` when the server
stops) -- moved from "not planned, needs EventEmitter" to a real Phase 3
candidate below, now that the blocker is gone. Custom headers and response
streaming remain blocked on unrelated gaps (a header-collection type, a
`Stream` abstraction) that `EventEmitter` doesn't touch.

## Not planned (this pass)

| Group | Needs |
| --- | --- |
| Custom request/response headers (set or read) | a header-collection type; the same growable-array/`Map`-construction gap that deferred `url`'s querystring |
| Response headers on the client side | `std.http.Client.fetch`'s convenience wrapper only surfaces `status`; reading response headers needs the lower-level request/response object flow underneath it, not investigated this pass |
| `http.Server`/`IncomingMessage`/`ServerResponse`/`ClientRequest`/`Agent` as real classes | Node's classes bundle request/response *data* (headers, streaming body) with the event mechanism; `EventEmitter` alone doesn't supply the data half, which still needs the header-collection/`Stream` gaps closed first |
| Server lifecycle events (`'error'`, `'close'`) via `EventEmitter<T>` | genuinely reachable now (see above) -- real follow-up, not attempted in this pass's Phase 1/2 |
| Streaming request/response bodies (chunked reads, backpressure) | needs a `Stream` abstraction, not built yet -- everything here is one-shot, whole-body |
| ~~Concurrent/multi-connection serving~~ | ~~the accept loop is single-threaded and blocking, one connection served at a time~~ -- **shipped in spec 049**: each accepted connection is now handled on a worker thread from a dedicated `libxev.ThreadPool` |
| Idle keep-alive connection timeouts | a connection is currently held open indefinitely as long as the client keeps sending requests and doesn't send `Connection: close`; no timeout closes an idle-but-still-open connection yet |
| ~~`http.METHODS`/`STATUS_CODES` constants~~ | **shipped in spec 049**, as plain zero-arg-function constants matching `Math.PI()`'s existing precedent |
| HTTPS/TLS-specific configuration, WebSocket upgrade, `Agent`/connection pooling exposure | each a real, separate feature; `std.http.Client` handles basic TLS internally already for `https://` URLs on the client side, just not exposed as configuration |
