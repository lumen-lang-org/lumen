// Ambient declarations for editor / tsc compatibility.
//
// Lumen's source is TypeScript *syntax*, but it has a few names plain TypeScript
// does not know. Referencing this file lets standard tsc/eslint/editor tooling
// type-check and lint `.ts` sources without "cannot find name" errors. The Lumen
// compiler itself ignores this file and applies its own, stricter rules.

// Numeric and boolean type spellings. To Lumen these are DISTINCT types (e.g.
// `i32` vs `i64`, integer vs float), checked as such by the compiler; to plain
// TypeScript they collapse to `number`/`boolean` — enough to keep tooling quiet
// without claiming tsc enforces Lumen's numeric rules.
type int = number;
type i32 = number;
type i64 = number;
type float = number;
type f64 = number;
type bool = boolean;

// `Ref<T>` is a by-reference parameter in Lumen; to TypeScript it is just an
// identity alias.
type Ref<T> = T;

// Runtime globals Lumen provides. Declared here (rather than relying on the DOM
// lib) so tooling type-checks `console.log(...)` without pulling in browser
// globals — the generated tsconfig keeps `lib` to `ESNext` only, so there is no
// duplicate-`console` clash.
declare const console: {
  log(...args: any[]): void;

// The `crypto` namespace. Only the string-in/string-out calls are declared
// here; the Buffer-facing ones (`randomBytesBuffer`, `hmacSync`, `createHash`,
// …) need a `Buffer` type this file does not yet describe.
//
// `encrypt` seals a string under a 32-byte `key` with AES-256-GCM and returns
// a base64 envelope; `decrypt` opens one, returning `""` for any envelope this
// key did not produce. `randomKey()` returns a key of the right length —
// nothing else here produces one, and a key of any other length is rejected
// rather than padded or truncated.

// `using` resource management (TypeScript 5.2). A `using x = value;` declaration
// disposes `value` at the end of the enclosing scope; multiple declarations
// dispose in reverse (LIFO) order. The ESNext lib already defines `Disposable`
// with `[Symbol.dispose]`; this interface-merge documents the `dispose()` method
// Lumen calls on a class instance bound by `using`.
interface Disposable {

// deferred cleanup is `using _ = defer(() => /* cleanup */);`, which runs `fn`
// when the enclosing scope exits.
declare function defer(fn: () => void): Disposable;

// Compile-time embedding (spec 458). `embed(path)` is replaced by the contents
// of that file, and `embedDir(path)` by one `{ name, text }` entry per regular
// file directly in that directory, sorted by name. The path is a literal — it is
// read while compiling — and resolves against the source file that wrote it, so
// nothing is opened at run time and nothing ships beside the binary. Declared as
// functions here only so tsc can see a type; there is nothing to call.
declare function embed(path: string): string;
declare function embedDir(path: string): { name: string; text: string }[];

// What the compiler knows about a class (spec 477). All three are resolved
// while compiling and rewritten in place — `Class.nameOf` becomes the class's
// name as a string literal, `Class.decorator` a reference to the constant that
// decorator left beside the class, and `Class.invoke` a call to a generated
// chain of direct method calls. Nothing named `Class` exists at run time, and
// there is no reflection in the binary. Declared here only so tsc can see a
// type; `any` is as close as plain TypeScript gets to "the method's own return
// type, resolved from the class".

// Testing. `test("name", () => { ... })` declares a test run by `lumen test`
// (Jest/Vitest/node:test-style). Inside a test body, `expect` asserts either a
// boolean condition or a matcher on a value:
//   expect(cond);                       // boolean assertion
//   expect(actual).toBe(expected);      // strict equality
//   expect(actual).toEqual(expected);   // strict equality (V1 alias of toBe)
